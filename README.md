# ðŸŒ¹ Redeyes

Redeyes is an extremely simple and compact url shortener in Python.

It is built with Flask and supports a wide range of different shortening styles and configuration methods. The primary and currently only database adapter is built using psycopg, for PostgreSQL, but redeyes is built in a way which it can be extended with many other adapters in the future.

**Abilities and Features:**

- Extensible design, but sane by default.
- Compact: it only requires a single server running Python and a database.
- Pure and pretty HTML UI; completely JavaScript-free!
- Simplisticâ€”only two routes.
